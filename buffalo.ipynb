    "Let us not enumerate over all possible interpretations. Rather, let us restrict our attention to a couple of\n",

    "#### Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this capitalization, there is only one (suitable capitalized instance) of the string `'buffalo'` which can\n",
    "be taken to mean the city -- the very first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us reason through whehter the first instance of `'buffalo'` (blind to capitalization) can be interpreted as the verb. To interpret the first word as a verb (which makes the sentence imperative), the remainder of the sentence has to be intepreted as a noun phrase which does not use the string `'buffalo'` in the sense of the city (because of capitalization). This forces the second `'buffalo'` to be interpreted as the collective noun and the final `'buffalo'` to be interpreted as the verb. This, in turn, forces the third, fourth, and fifth `'buffalo'` instances to themselves form a self-contained noun phrase which does not use `'buffalo'` in reference to the city (capitalization again). There is only one such noun phrase (using the same kind of reasoning we used to get to this stage) -- buffalo (mammals) [which] buffalo (mammals) buffalo (intimidate or awe). Therefore, we can interpret this particular capitalization for $n = 6$ as a command to buffalo [second `'buffalo'`] who are intimidated or overawed [sixth `'buffalo'`] by buffalo [third `'buffalo'`] who are themselves intimidated or overawed [fifth `'buffalo'`] by buffalo [fourth `'buffalo'`] to themselves buffalo [first `'buffalo'`] (everything around them, presumably).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see whether the second instance of `'buffalo'` in the same sentence can be interpreted as a verb. In order for this to happen, the first instance has to refer to the collective noun, and the third through final instances must form a noun phrase. Moreover, due to the capitalization constraints, this noun phrase must not contain any references to the city of Buffalo. This means that the third instance of `'buffalo'` in the whole sentence must refer to the mammals and the final instance must refer to the verb. This forces the fourth and fifth instances to form their own noun phrase which (again) cannot contain a reference to the city. There is no such noun phrase! Therefore, there is no interpretation of the above sentence in which the second instance of `'buffalo'` can be interpreted as a verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the above argument does allow us to make a minor modification to the sentence and turn the second `'buffalo'` into a verb: **\"Buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo.\"** This turns the grouping of the fourth and fifth `'buffalo'` instances into the noun phrase meaning buffalo (mammals) from Buffalo (the city). Taken as a whole this new capitalization, the second `'buffalo'` instance is interpreted as a verb, means that Buffalo (mammals) buffalo (intimidate or overawe) buffalo (mammals) who are buffaloed (intimidated or overawed) by buffalo (mammals) from Buffalo (the city)."

    "### Buffalo noun phrases of arbitrary length\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion of the examples above gives us enough ammunition with which to prove the Buffalo theorem. The key to our proof (which is simply an existing proof) will be identifying all the different noun phrases that comprise only of instances of the string `'buffalo'` (with suitable capitalization -- note that the statement of the theorem does not depend on the distinction between different capitalizations).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buffalo noun phrase lemma.* For any positive integer $n$, there exists a suitably capitalized, ` `-separated concatenation of instances of the string `'buffalo'` which forms a valid noun phrase. Moreover, each of these noun phrases refers to a collective.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Proof.* \"buffalo\" and \"Buffalo buffalo\" are valid collective noun phrases for $n = 1$ and $n = 2$. Now we proceed by induction. For a given $n > 2$, a collective noun phrase of length $n$ can be formed as: `NP1 NP2 buffalo`, where `NP1` and `NP2` are noun phrases whose lengths add up to $n-1$, `NP1` is a collective noun phrase, and the final `'buffalo'` instance is interpreted as the verb. Now we can proceed by induction. Assuming that noun phrases exist of length $k$ for every positive integer $k < n$, then we finding `NP1` and `NP2` is a triviality -- we can simply take `NP1` to be the (collective noun) buffalo and we can take `NP2` to be a noun phrase of length $n-2$, the existence of which is guaranteed by the inductive hypothesis. This proves the lemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buffalo-sentences of arbitrary length\n",
    "\n",
    "For a positive integer $n$, let us describe a construction of a buffalo-sentence of length $n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an integer $k$ with $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ and determine that the $k^{th}$ instance of `'buffalo'` in our desired sentence should be interpreted as a verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a collective noun phrase of length $k - 1$ to place before position $k$ and a noun phrase of length $n - k$ to place after position $k$. (Let us extend the Buffalo noun phrase lemma to the case $n = 0$ by agreeing on the convention of the empty noun phrase.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Capitalize the first `'buffalo'` instance if required and add a `.` at the end of the construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the Buffalo noun phrase lemma, we know that this yields a syntactically correct (this was the purpose of step 3) sentence with the structure:\n",
